# Automating-Classification-of-Galaxies-Stars-and-Quasars
This is the repository for my graduate Machine Learning class's (CAP 5610) Final Term Project. The "TermProject-JadenHuelle.ipynb" notebook contains the source code for a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that was trained to classify celestial objects. The MLP was trained on my modified version of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) dataset.
